# tickOnScreen
A tool for the teachers to put tick mark or wrong mark in students' answer sheet with just a single click. It saves a lot of time for teachers when evaluating answer sheets in bulk. I developed this tool for my aunt who's a teacher.
Please feel free to download and use.
point the cursor where you want to mark and
enter 'r' to put a tick mark
enter 'w' to put a wrong mark
enter 'q' to stop the program from running.
Thank you.
